    <h3>Guitar</h3>
    <p>I've been playing guitar for about four years now. Here are a few videos of me playing some songs.</p>
    <p>Most of my new guitar videos are just posted on my <a href="/thoughts/">blog</a> now.</p>
    <p><b>Goodbye Blue Sky (Pink Floyd)</b></p>

    <p><b>Here Comes The Sun (The Beatles)</b></p>

    <p><b>Dead Flag Blues (GY!BE)</b></p>
    <p>Playing with loops and Godspeed You Black Emperor!'s song <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOYdQOLkqf4" target="_blank">Dead Flag Blues</a> (starting at the part <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvrLpLRLF2c" target="_blank">10 minutes</a> into the song). I wish I had a loop pedal or some software so I could just press a button instead of having to stop each time, and then I could do it all at once. And I wish I had a violin player in my band. This was an experiment more than anything.</p>

    <p><b>Edge Of The World (Josh Ritter)</b></p>
    <p>I did this one as another experiment in making a video of me playing a bunch instruments over top of one another. It ended up becoming repetitive pretty quickly so I'm planning to redo this and plan it out a little more first (also, I can't play piano).</p>
